Life turns on a dime. There’s no better example of this than a pandemic that in just a few months has dramatically changed the ways we live, work, and interact.

There is no blueprint for what we are living through, but to be surrounded in difficult times by so many people willing to roll up their sleeves is a blessing. I am deeply appreciative of essential workers everywhere who place themselves in harm’s way for the common good.

I am saddened, though, by the impacts we’ve all witnessed. We’ve lost members of our own extended community, and countless families and individuals have been upended by COVID-19. Wearing masks and practicing social distancing remain the most effective measures we can take to protect our own health and the health of others. Thanks to all who embrace that guidance. Together we can change the course of this pandemic.

While the ebb-and-flow of COVID cases still obscures our near-term future — at this point we anticipate mostly remote instruction this fall with a few small laboratory and studio classes held in person — I believe it actually highlights our long-term vision. UC Santa Cruz and the county have for years fostered partnerships. Our faculty, students and staff, grounded in the values of social justice and equity, work with community nonprofits, volunteer in local schools, and take part in numerous research partnerships aimed at tackling the issues of our region. This pandemic has melded us still closer, as we seek new ways to harness our resources and expertise to better the community.

It is in this spirit that UC Santa Cruz and the Community Foundation Santa Cruz County are now partnering to ensure the area’s low-income and vulnerable residents have access to rapid COVID-19 testing. A campus lab is testing 400 to 600 samples every week collected by Salud Para la Gente and Santa Cruz Community Health, nonprofit health centers that provide care regardless of a patient’s ability to pay. The Community Foundation is funding the effort.

It became obvious in the early days of this pandemic that a lack of testing would be a weak link in our collective fight against the virus. Our scientists and staff saw an opportunity to help fill this gap. UC Santa Cruz has expertise in RNA, molecular biology, virology and vaccine development. We have ecology and evolutionary biologists who study infectious disease dynamics. We have lab space. We could undertake diagnostic testing.

So we pivoted. Many of our scientists and researchers dropped longtime projects and directed their attention instead at a virus that has disrupted the lives of billions. Others worked on getting the lab up and running. The state approved our testing facility in early May, and since then the UC Santa Cruz Molecular Diagnostic Lab has run thousands of tests for our campus health center and for Santa Cruz Community Health, providing results in about 24 hours. Our partnership with the Community Foundation is a natural expansion of this work.

Our campus lab significantly boosts local testing capacity. This is crucial as civic leaders navigate the fraught waters of economic reopening. As we’ve seen, cases can surge, requiring diligent contact tracing and the testing of all who have had contact with someone found to be infected. Santa Cruz County is helping us expand our capacity further. County leaders plan to direct $805,000 in federal CARES Act money to the lab, allowing us to buy the equipment needed to process still more tests. The investment is generous, and an example of the great power of local partnerships.

Our researchers and scientists are among the best in their fields. The work they do has tangible impacts on the lives of people worldwide and countywide. I am tremendously proud to be a part of this Santa Cruz County community of problem-solvers.
